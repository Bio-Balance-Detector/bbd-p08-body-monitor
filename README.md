# BBD Body Monitor

## Bio-Potential Analysis with Machine Learning for Holistic Health Insights

BBD Body Monitor is a single channel data acquisition system (DAS) to provide a bio-potential reading in the 0.25Hz - 125kHz frequency range for individuals who wish to better understand their own bio-potentials. The main focus of the prototype is to use machine learning to detect different mental states (eg. focused wakefulness, relaxation, meditation, REM sleeping, deep sleeping or lucid dreaming) by digitizing potential changes on our bodies. 

If this stage succeeds, fitness and medical data will be integrated into the machine learning framework for early detection of health imbalances. 

We're designing it to be a convenient wearable device, with sensors located on the forearm or calf, providing real-time feedback on your condition. 

## Goals
- Detect various mental states such as:
  - Focused wakefulness
  - Relaxation
  - Meditation
  - REM sleep
  - Deep sleep
  - Lucid dreaming
- Detect various emotions such as:
  - Contentment
  - Joyfulness
  - Flow state
  - Anger
  - Frustration
- Correlate fitness and medical data with physical and mental medical conditions for early detection of health imbalances

## Technical Details

If you're curious about the nuts and bolts behind BBD Body Monitor, delve into our [technical requirements](/Documentation/TechnicalRequirements.md). Want to set up your own test system? Check out our [setup guides](/Documentation/Setup.md) tailored for Windows, Linux, and Raspberry Pi platforms.

If you are brave enough, you can even have a peek at [the workflow](/Documentation/Workflow.md) that I use during my daily work, including the data acquisition, ML model traning and state predictions.
 
## Conclusion

The project is actively ongoing and the results are promising. Detecting different people and their different states seems to be possible in a reliable way. 

**The core question remains**: Can this technique reliably detect health issues?

As a next step I will need to collect as much data as possible, so I'm looking for healthcare providers to work with. One such potential cooperation could be done with labs that analyze blood samples. If I could make quick measurements before/during/after the blood sampling and I had enough (anonymized) data to look for correlations between my measurements and the blood test results, it would potentially lead to a new, non-invasive, cheap way to check for health imbalances.
