# BBD Body Monitor

## Bio-Potential Analysis with Machine Learning for Holistic Health Insights

BBD Body Monitor is a single channel data acquisition system (DAS) to provide a bio-potential reading in the 0.25Hz - 125kHz frequency range for individuals who wish to better understand their own bio-potentials. The main focus of the prototype is to use machine learning to detect different mental states (eg. focused wakefulness, relaxation, meditation, REM sleeping, deep sleeping or lucid dreaming) by digitizing potential changes on our bodies. 

If this stage succeeds, fitness and medical data will be integrated into the machine learning framework for early detection of health imbalances. 

We're designing it to be a convenient wearable device, with sensors located on the forearm or calf, providing real-time feedback on your condition. 

## Impact

Given my background as a C# software developer for 20 years and researcher with interests in health preservation, AI, and bio-electromagnetism, I'm uniquely positioned to lead this project. As the visionary behind the Bio Balance Detector series, my latest innovation is the BBD Body Monitor - a portable, Raspberry Pi-powered device that's revolutionizing healthcare monitoring. I'm leveraging the power of Raspberry Pi and AI to create a portable, battery-powered device that not only acquires crucial health data but also predicts mental states and detects physical activities. Integrated with Fitbit and capable of incorporating medical history and blood tests, this device offers a comprehensive view of an individual's health. With built-in scheduling and untapped potential for treatment applications, I aim to revolutionize healthcare by providing practitioners with a multi-faceted tool for proactive patient care.

And given its current state and future potential, here's how it could impact the healthcare sector:

1. **Holistic Health Monitoring:** Combines multiple data points like mental state, physical activity, sleep patterns, and medical history for a comprehensive health overview.
  
2. **Predictive Analytics:** Uses AI to predict mental states, which could be a game-changer in mental health treatment and monitoring.
  
3. **Activity Recognition:** Can detect activities like exercise, providing valuable data for fitness and rehabilitation programs.
  
4. **Portability & Convenience:** Runs on a small Raspberry Pi, battery-powered for 8 hours, making it versatile and easy to use in various settings.
  
5. **Sleep Monitoring:** Integrated with Fitbit, it offers robust sleep tracking, which is crucial for overall well-being, detecting unusual states like sleep paralysis and lucid dreaming.
  
6. **Data-Driven Healthcare:** Allows for the uploading of medical history and blood tests, enabling healthcare providers to make informed decisions.
  
7. **Scheduling:** Helps both patients and healthcare providers keep track of health metrics and treatments over time.
  
8. **Untapped Treatment Potential:** The signal generator module could pave the way for treating specific conditions in the future.

## Technical Details

If you're curious about the nuts and bolts behind BBD Body Monitor, delve into our [technical requirements](/Documentation/TechnicalRequirements.md). Want to set up your own test system? Check out our [setup guides](/Documentation/Setup.md) tailored for Windows, Linux, and Raspberry Pi platforms.

If you are brave enough, you can even have a peek at [the workflow](/Documentation/Workflow.md) that I use during my daily work, including the data acquisition, ML model traning and state predictions.
 
## Conclusion

The project is actively ongoing and the results are promising. Detecting different people and their different states seems to be possible in a reliable way. 

**The core question remains**: Can this technique reliably detect health issues?

As a next step I will need to collect as much data as possible, so I'm looking for healthcare providers and practitioners to work with. One such potential cooperation could be done with labs that analyze blood samples. If I could make quick measurements before/during/after the blood sampling and I had enough (anonymized) data to look for correlations between my measurements and the blood test results, it would potentially lead to a new, non-invasive, cheap way to check for health imbalances.
